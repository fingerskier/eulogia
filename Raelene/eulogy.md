Summing up 70 years of life is impossible.
Words can't capture it all, but the testimony of Raelene's life is here at this gravesite: 
a loving husband, children, grandchildren, siblings, nieces, and nephews.

Raelene loved to read, joke, and laugh. 
Raelene cherished her family and friends, evident by how deeply her passing affected us all. 
Raelene's relationships were intimate and precious.

Raelene was selfless, giving freely of her time and attention. 
Raelene was also stubborn and tough, a trait we lovingly recognize as inherited from her mother.

Raelene will be sorely missed, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy she left. 
This time is for us to thank God for Raelene and honor her. 
The best way to do that is to continue: to love our family and neighbors, to use the love Raelene poured into us, and to make the world better.

In the days, weeks, and months ahead, we'll feel Raelene's absence deeply. 
When someone asks about her, it will reopen the wound. 
But in those moments, be grateful. 
We feel this deeply because we were loved deeply by Raelene.

We are not alone: a part of Raelene is with us, and God is with us. 
Raelene would be proud of how we continue on together.
