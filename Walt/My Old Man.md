At one point during Dad's 32 day hospital stay Mom said, "Matt, you look so tired- I want you to be here because you want to be, not because you feel obligated."
My response was, "Mom, those are the same thing."

We are blessed beyond imagining to be part of a family, and serve a God, for whom it is worth giving every ounce of effort. 

I remember one summer when we had, for some reason, a short time to chop and store 3 fields of sileage.
Dad gave me the choice, probably because I was complaining about the heat, to either stay up late to finish or get up early. 
I choose the night shift. 
So, we worked deep into the night- Dad drove the chopper and wagon, I drove the dump truck.
It was actually pretty fun tooling around ranch roads in the dark running big machines. 

About 3 in the morning I pulled up alongside the dump wagon and heard the tractor shut off. 
Dad pulled the plug and we went home to hit the sack- I may have even showered first. 
The next morning I oozed out of bed just before noon and went to find him. 
He was my alarm clock on workdays, beating on the door every 15 minutes till I finally gathered myself. 
I assumed he was also recovering but, no, Mom informed me that he was up and or at his usual hour.
so, I went back or to meet him and help finish up the field. 

I didn't have to, he had tacitly given me time off.
But I wanted to go because that's the standard that was set. 
I'm proud to say I finally loved up to that standards at age 50-
I am currently 45...for the third time...

It's hard to explain fatherhood to a young man who hasn't raised a child. 
It's impossible to express it to anyone else. 
Our very best human examples are flawed;
and the path is one that not many have walked. 
A father watches his son take off down a path, knowing the hardships it holds in store; 
then sits at the other end and waits because he had been there before. 

A man's legacy is stuff and things. 
A father's legacy is his family.
