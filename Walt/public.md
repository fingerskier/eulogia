I am the potential Bill in a China shop.
A bit weight and clumsy in most ways. 
Dad was an actual bull in a China ship. 
The myth busters did an episode where they ran bulls through a own with racks of dishes. 
it turns out those massive, strong animals are quite nimble. 


Statistically speaking, 1 out of 1 of us will die;
and 1 of us will be the next one.
In case you're struggling with the maths that's a 100% mortality rate. 
So, it doesn't do to dwell on loss or regrets.
We certainly should not despair.
Rather, in light of the inevitable we ought to count ourselves blessed.
Blessed that we had someone so special that their absence is felt this deeply.

The blessing was not simply that we were cared for.
Many live by the golden rule: 
do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
But this is not the Christian way.
The way of Jesus is:
do unto others who can do nothing for you.
In fact, Jesus did unto those who hated Him.

This is what Dad epitomized: he gave grace and mercy, undeserved favor and blessing.
This is why we'll miss him terribly.
It's not because we don't believe he's in a better place;
not because we don't think he's finally in eternal peace and comfort;
but because he was such a blessing to us that he leaves a tremendous gap in our lives.
And what a tremendous gift from God he is that we should feel his loss so profoundly.
Because he didn't just work and strive but led a family and left a legacy.
