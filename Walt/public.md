I am the potential Bill in a China shop.
A bit weight and clumsy in most ways. 
Dad was an actual bull in a China ship. 
The myth busters did an episode where they ran bulls through a own with racks of dishes. 
it turns out those massive, strong animals are quite noble. 



Statistically speaking, 1 out of 1 of us will die;
and 1 of us will be the next one.
The question, in light of this, is- how then should we live?

Many live by the golden rule: 
do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
But this is not the Christian way.
The way of Jesus is:
do unto others who can do nothing for you.
In fact, Jesus did unto those who hated Him.

This is what Dad epitomized: he gave grace and mercy, undeserved favor and blessing.
This is why we'll miss him terribly.
It's not because we don't believe he's in a better place;
not because we don't think he's finally in eternal peace and comfort;
but because he was such a blessing to us that he leaves a tremendous gap in our lives.
And what a tremendous gift from God he is that we should feel his loss so profoundly.
Because he didn't just work and strive but led a family and left a legacy.
