Statistically speaking, 1 out of 1 of us will die;
and 1 of us will be the next one.
In case you're struggling with the maths that's a 100% mortality rate. 
So, it doesn't do to dwell on loss or regrets.
We certainly should not despair.
Rather, in light of the inevitable we ought to count ourselves blessed.
Blessed that we had someone so special that their absence is felt this deeply.

The blessing was not simply that we were cared for.
Many live by the golden rule: 
do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
But that is not sufficient to explain a life like this.
The Christian way, which I think Dad epitomized was:
do unto others who can do nothing for you.
In fact, Jesus did unto those who hated Him.
Which, if we're honest, was all of us at some time, in some way.
He gave grace and mercy, undeserved favor and blessing.

What a tremendous legacy from God that he didn't just work and strive but led a family and left things better than he found them.
It's with this advantage that we move forward. 
We accept that we have an inspired place in this life. 
God placed us in this time and place for a reason.
Why shouldn't it be said of each of us, a hundred years from now, that our loss was felt as deeply because we too loved as much.
