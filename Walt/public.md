The human morality rate is very high. 
Statistically speaking, one out of one of us will die;
and one of us will be the next one. 
Yet it hurts deeply to lose a loved one. 
Because they occupy such a special place.

A parent is more special because they taught us grace and mercy by giving us grace and mercy. 
The best the world has to offer is the given rule: 
do unto others as you'd have then do unto you.
But this is not the Christian way, that way is:
so unto others who can do nothing for you. 
In fact, Christ not only did unto the dregs of society but also to those who hated him.
