Statistically speaking, 1 out of 1 of us will die.
In case you're struggling with the maths that's a 100% mortality rate;
and 1 of us will be the next one.
So, it isn't a surprise that our loved ones pass, just when and how;
And it doesn't do to dwell on loss or regret.
Rather, in light of the inevitable we ought to count ourselves blessed-
Blessed that we had someone so special that their absence is felt this deeply.

Dad's blessing to us was not simply that we were cared for.
Many people live by the golden rule: 
do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
But that is not sufficient to explain a life like his.
The Christian way, which I think Dad epitomized was:
do unto others who can do nothing for you.
In fact, Jesus did unto those who hated Him.
Which, if we're honest, was all of us at some time, in some way- no matter how brief or small.
He gave grace and mercy: we got favor that we didn't deserve, and didn't suffer a lot of things that we did deserve.

Dad was smart, skilled, and industrious. 
He loved his family deeply and cared greatly about family legacy;
not family possessions but the love and wisdom that ought to pass from one generation to the next. 

What a tremendous legacy from God that he didn't just work and strive but led a family and left things better than he found them.
It's with this advantage that we move forward. 
We accept that his place in our lives was inspired by God.
And we accept the further inspiration from God to pass forward the love and wisdom that he gave us.
God put us in this place at this time for a reason-
to know Him and make Him known.
Why shouldn't it be said of each of us, a hundred years from now, that our loss was felt as deeply because we too loved as much as the man loved us.
