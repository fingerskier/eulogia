Father is someone who willingly teaches life lessons to a student who
  doesn't know they need them,
  at their own expense.  

Dad is someone who gives grace and mercy:
  the best they have, undserved;
  withholding the worst, totally deserved. 

Abba watches his child willingly give everything,
  without intervening,
  disallowing the sacrificial life to be in vain.

What manner of creature is it,
  and how vast a creator,
  that every pupil would attend this school.
