# Dad

God expended a considerable amount of effort to reveal, codify, and transmit His word to us:
first as stories, later as the written word.
For eons scribes, theologians, and priests have carefully transmitted it from one generation to the next to preserve God's message for us.

But, when it comes to shear effort so much more energy was expended giving us tangible examples of His love in every family.
Even the worst father serves as a reminder of what we are missing.
The best fathers leave us with a portion of God's love in flesh & blood.

A dad is a stalwart warrior, ready to give his life for his family;
  willing to work diligently and slavishly for years;
  willing to hold a purse outside a bathroom and suffer a tea-party;
whose heart melts when his baby girl hurts,
  yet doesn't refrain from dressing her down as needed-
  because another dad once nurtured on the girl who would become his wife;
who watches his son go down the wrong path,
  yet sits waiting at the other end to guide him back home-
  because he once went that way himself.

Our Creator knew that words given to us would only go so far;
  so, to express His fatherly love for us he gave us dad;
  to lead, to discipline, to knock us off our pedestals;
  to embody grace, mercy, and charity.
