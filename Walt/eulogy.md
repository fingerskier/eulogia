# WBC Eulogy

They say the purest measure of a man is his charity toward those who can give nothing in return.
It begins with siring youngsters.
But somehow cleaning a _movement_ and redressing a diaper isn't too uncultural, even for the manliest man.

Phase two is the addition of bonus children-
my parents passed on the kind of family that others wanted to be a part of.
Entrusting a child, especially a daughter, to a daunting and gut-wrenching prospect;
even though the dad's only claim is societal.

Part C is grandchildren.
In a way they are easier yet- a spring-loaded chubby you wind up and toss back.
In a way they represent another fragile link in the lineage.

All of these are opportunity for a man to show his character through provision of intellectual, spiritual, and material good.
But these can be faked or, at least, done for other personal reasons.

The truest measure of a man is in the actions of those he trained;
because most training ends up being tone-of-voice, willingness, and non-knowledgeable things rather than rote behaviors.
In the end the human father declines, in need of care and it is we who take up the mantle that he created.
We thank for his example that showed us the fullest kind of living.
And where he fell short we thank God for his example better things to be had.

It is a powerful experience to examine and recount your dwindling dad.
Especially when that man exudes such a powerful love for his people- each and as a whole.

I managed, during his month-long hospital stay, to refrain from airing my regrets and apologies.
That is an unnecessary endeavor- the son with children understands much and is well understood.
There is no need to forgive, and heedless we forget.

At one point during the grind of treatments and procedures and doctors and bedpans my mom said, 
"I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because you feel obligated to be here."
I told her, "Mom, those are the same thing."

Would that all were so blessed to be part of something so profound that it hurts to lose it.
Would that I had the fortitude and courage to pass on even a fraction of it to my heirs.
Thank God for fathers- especially mine!
What a lofty pedestal they erect upon their backs and what an honor for us to climb from there.
